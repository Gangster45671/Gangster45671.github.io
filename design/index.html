Anyone should be able to use it, without any prior expirience or a manual to read. It will most probably be in the form of a website.</a></td>

It must be able to remotely communicate, locate itself, conserve power in order to last a long time and be easy to use. It needs to perform these functions to be better than commercially available products, and to be more effective than manually looking for keys. It will do these functions through radio-communication, sound, light and other means. The only requirement to where it will work, is that it must work whithin the school.</td>

					<th>Research Summary</th>

						<td>
							<p>Many changes have been made to the design. Here's a list:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>It does not use a GPS Module</li>
								<li>It does not upload anything to WiFi or MQTT</li>
								<li>It has no web interface</li>
								<li>It is even simpler to use</li>
								<li>It lasts only 14 hours.</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							<p>
								These changes have been made due to many reasons. But mainly; I had a lot of trouble getting my product to work.
								The first problem I had was connecting to the internet. The school's WiFi encryption was not compatible with the NodeMCU module. I spent over 5 classes trying to sort out the issue, but I just couldn't. Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.
								The second main problem was that I couldn't get the GPS module to respond, or to anything for that matter. No communication from the GPS module to the NodeMCU worked. This meant that I could not use the GPS module.

					<td>Function: Must use Wi-Fi, and must have a proper, easy-to-use interface. 
						Should at least Beep, the more locating actions the better.
						Battery must last at least 2 weeks.</td>
					<td>My product defenetly uses WiFi, although not in the intended way. It uses WiFi to do the locating, instead Of the communicating.
					
					The finding actions have been improved massively. Instead Of a dinky little buzzer I've removed that completely and went overboard. I added a 3W audio amplifier and a speaker. It is now really loud, specially for it's size. I'm really happy wtithe volume, the product vibrates while sounding.
					
					Because Of the changes in the software, and limitations with time. I was not able to add any power saving. This drastically affected the battery life. The keyfinder lasts at worst 10 hours on a full charge. It's not great but It is defenetly acceptable. Specially since I added a power button, meaning the the client can just turn the finder on before moving the keys.</td>

					<td>Asthetics: It must look acceptable</td>

					<td>Cost: CAP (Cheap As Possible)</td>
					<td>Since the GPS module was not used, and it was the most expensive part. The cost has been reduced greatly. Making more of these keychain would be as cheap as possible.</td>
